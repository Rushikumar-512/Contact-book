# Basic Contact Book (Python)

This is a simple command-line project I built while learning Python.  
It works like a small contact management system where we can add, view, update, delete, and search contacts.  
All contact details are saved in a local JSON file, so the data is not lost even after closing the program.

## Features
- Add new contacts with name, phone, email, and address  
- View all saved contacts in a list  
- Update or delete existing contacts  
- Search contacts by name, phone, or email  
- Stores data in a JSON file for easy access and modification  

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3 on your computer.  
2. Download or clone this repository:
   ```bash
